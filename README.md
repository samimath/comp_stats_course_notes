# Notes and teaching material for computational statistics
This repo contains lecture notes and R code I've developed as an instructor for a course in computational statistics. Material is based largely on the textbook,[Computational Statistics
Second Edition](https://www.stat.colostate.edu/computationalstatistics/) by by [Geof H. Givens](https://www.stat.colostate.edu/~geof/)and [Jennifer A. Hoeting](https://www.stat.colostate.edu/~jah/).
